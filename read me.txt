CREDIT_CARD_FRAUD_DETECTION

Credit card fraud is a significant concern for financial institutions and consumers. Machine learning can be used to detect fraudulent transactions by analyzing large volumes of data and identifying patterns of suspicious activity. The project involves building a machine learning model that can accurately classify credit card transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent.

The project will begin with data collection and preprocessing, which involves gathering transaction data and cleaning it to remove any irrelevant or missing information. Feature engineering will also be performed to extract relevant features from the data that will help the model identify patterns.

Next, a machine learning model will be trained using various algorithms such as logistic regression, random forest, or neural networks to identify fraudulent transactions accurately. The model will be tested using a separate set of data to evaluate its accuracy and performance.

To improve the model's accuracy, a combination of techniques like undersampling, oversampling, and ensemble methods can be used. Once the model is trained and tested, it will be deployed into a real-time system that can analyze incoming transactions and flag any suspicious activity.

The project's ultimate goal is to provide a robust and accurate fraud detection system that can help financial institutions detect fraudulent transactions quickly and prevent losses for both the institutions and their customers.
